# [0.0.0](https://github.com/ory/fosite/compare/v0.42.2...v0.0.0) (2022-09-22)

## Breaking Changes

Please be aware that several internal APIs have changed, as well as public methods. Most notably, we added the context to all `Write*` metods.

```patch
 type OAuth2Provider interface {
-    WriteAuthorizeError(rw http.ResponseWriter, requester AuthorizeRequester, err error)
+    WriteAuthorizeError(ctx context.Context, rw http.ResponseWriter, requester AuthorizeRequester, err error)

-    WriteAuthorizeResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, requester AuthorizeRequester, responder AuthorizeResponder)
+    WriteAuthorizeResponse(ctx context.Context, rw http.ResponseWriter, requester AuthorizeRequester, responder AuthorizeResponder)

-    WriteAccessError(rw http.ResponseWriter, requester AccessRequester, err error)
+    WriteAccessError(ctx context.Context, rw http.ResponseWriter, requester AccessRequester, err error)

-    WriteAccessResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, requester AccessRequester, responder AccessResponder)
+    WriteAccessResponse(ctx context.Context, rw http.ResponseWriter, requester AccessRequester, responder AccessResponder)

-    WriteRevocationResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, err error)
+    WriteRevocationResponse(ctx context.Context, rw http.ResponseWriter, err error)

-    WriteIntrospectionError(rw http.ResponseWriter, err error)
+    WriteIntrospectionError(ctx context.Context, rw http.ResponseWriter, err error)

-    WriteIntrospectionResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, r IntrospectionResponder)
+    WriteIntrospectionResponse(ctx context.Context, rw http.ResponseWriter, r IntrospectionResponder)
 }
```

The default config struct has moved from package `github.com/ory/fosite/compose.Config` to `github.com/ory/fosite.Config`. Struct `github.com/ory/fosite.Fosite` no longer has any configuration parameters
itself.

Please note that the HMAC / global secret has to be set no longer in the compose call, but in the config initialization:

```patch
-compose.ComposeAllEnabled(&compose.Config{}, store, secret, privateKey)
+compose.ComposeAllEnabled(&fosite.Config{GlobalSecret: secret}, store, privateKey)
```

Many internal interfaces have been changed, usually adding `ctx context.Context` as the first parameter.

### Code Refactoring

- **config:** Support hot reloading ([1661401](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/16614014a42b3905d065188c8f1f45433c4353f9)), closes [#666](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/666):

  This patch updates the config system to be replacable and uses functions instead of struct fields. This allows implementing hot reloading mechanisms easily.

- Move to go 1.17 ([d9d0fed](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/d9d0fedaad87044e4d38ba82e01d9e430d09514c))

### Features

# [0.42.2](https://github.com/ory/fosite/compare/v0.42.1...v0.42.2) (2022-04-17)

autogen(docs): regenerate and update changelog

### Bug Fixes

- Always rollback ([#638](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/638)) ([7edf673](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/7edf673f20aece260f9ba677a07086c48835fba8)), closes [#637](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/637)
- Empty client secret via basic auth header means "none" authn ([#655](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/655)) ([7a2d972](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/7a2d9721f4b6da0e3b2b829ec4312de1e3d66b6f)), closes [/github.com/golang/oauth2/blob/ee480838109b20d468babcb00b7027c82f962065/internal/token.go#L174-L176](https://github.com//github.com/golang/oauth2/blob/ee480838109b20d468babcb00b7027c82f962065/internal/token.go/issues/L174-L176):

  The existing client authentication code treats an empty client_secret
  query parameter to be equivalent to "none" authentication instead of
  "client_secret_post."

  This change updates the basic auth check to be consistent with this.
  That is, an empty secret via the basic auth header is considered to
  mean "none" instead of "client_secret_basic."

  The "golang.org/x/oauth2" library probes for both methods of
  authentication, starting with the basic auth header approach first.

  As required, both client ID and secret are encoded in one header:

- Handle invalid_token error for refresh_token is expired ([#664](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/664)) ([76bb274](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/76bb274e95585d4552789abbd1c1f123463ff47e))
- Handle token_inactive error for multiple concurrent refresh requests ([#652](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/652)) ([7c8f4ae](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/7c8f4ae49550c61ff43d1a86adace4ed08c71e3e)):

  See https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3004

- Url-encode the fragment in the redirect URL of the authorize response ([#649](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/649)) ([beec138](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/beec13889c431ff06348c032dd260d00db253dd2)), closes [#648](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/648):

  This patch reverts the encoding logic for the fragment of the redirect URL returned as part of the authorize response to what was the one before version `0.36.0`. In that version, the code was refactored and the keys and values of the fragment ceased to be url-encoded. This in turn reflected on all Ory Hydra versions starting from `1.9.0` and provoked a breaking change that made the parsing of the fragment impossible if any of the params contain a character like `&` or `=` because they get treated as separators instead of as text

- Use the correct algorithm for at_hash and c_hash ([#659](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/659)) ([8cb4b4b](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/8cb4b4b0c57be8944e403a0f3ec588b19f49f6f7)), closes [#630](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/630)

# [0.36.0](https://github.com/ory/fosite/compare/v0.35.1...v0.36.0) (2020-11-16)

fix: be more permissive in time checks

Time equality should not cause failures in OpenID Connect validation.

## Breaking Changes

This patch removes fields `error_hint`, `error_debug` from error responses. To use the legacy error format where these fields are included, set `UseLegacyErrorFormat` to true in your compose config or directly on the `Fosite` struct. If `UseLegacyErrorFormat` is set, the `error_description` no longer merges `error_hint` nor `error_debug` messages which reverts a change introduced in `v0.33.0`. Instead, `error_hint` and `error_debug` are included and the merged message can be constructed from those fields.

As part of this change, the error interface and its fields have changed:

- `RFC6749Error.Name` was renamed to `RFC6749Error.ErrorField`.
- `RFC6749Error.Description` was renamed to `RFC6749Error.DescriptionField`.
- `RFC6749Error.Hint` was renamed to `RFC6749Error.HintField`.
- `RFC6749Error.Code` was renamed to `RFC6749Error.CodeField`.
- `RFC6749Error.Hint` was renamed to `RFC6749Error.HintField`.
- `RFC6749Error.WithCause()` was renamed to `RFC6749Error.WithWrap() *RFC6749Error` and alternatively to `RFC6749Error.Wrap()` (without return value) to standardize naming conventions around the new Go 1.14+ error interfaces.

As part of this change, methods `GetResponseMode`, `SetDefaultResponseMode`, `GetDefaultResponseMode ` where added to interface `AuthorizeRequester`. Also, methods `GetQuery`, `AddQuery`, and `GetFragment` were merged into one function `GetParameters` and `AddParameter` on the `AuthorizeResponder` interface. Methods on `AuthorizeRequest` and `AuthorizeResponse` changed accordingly and will need to be updated in your codebase. Additionally, the field `Debug` was renamed to `DebugField` and a new method `Debug() string` was added to `RFC6749Error`.

### Bug Fixes

- Allow all request object algs when client value is unset ([1d14636](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/1d14636e61b2047e5eee6d1d740249b819fc0794)):

  Allows all request object signing algorithms when the client has not explicitly allowed a certain algorithm. This follows the spec:

  > \*request_object_signing_alg - OPTIONAL. JWS [JWS] alg algorithm [JWA] that MUST be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client MUST be rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. Request Objects are described in Section 6.1 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core]. This algorithm MUST be used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). Servers SHOULD support RS256. The value none MAY be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.

- Always return non-error response for inactive tokens ([#517](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/517)) ([5f2cae3](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/5f2cae3eabb83da898e1b5515176e65dda4da862))

  Time equality should not cause failures in OpenID Connect validation.

- Do not accidentally leak jwks fetching errors ([6d2092d](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/6d2092da1e8699e43fd6dccb4c3a33b885cec7f8)), closes [/github.com/ory/fosite/pull/526#discussion_r517491738](https://github.com//github.com/ory/fosite/pull/526/issues/discussion_r517491738)
- Do not require nonce for hybrid flows ([de5c8f9](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/de5c8f90e8ccae0849fa6426d53563ef7520880d)):

- Only use allowed characters in error_description ([431f9a5](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/431f9a56ed03648ea4ef637fe6c2b6d74e765dad)), closes [#525](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/525):

  Replace LF and quotes with `.` and `'` to match allowed and recommended character set defined in various RFCs.

- Prevent debug details from leaking during key lookup ([c0598fb](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/c0598fb8d8ce75b7f0ad645420caea641e64a4d2)), closes [/github.com/ory/fosite/pull/526#discussion_r517490461](https://github.com//github.com/ory/fosite/pull/526/issues/discussion_r517490461)

- Use state from request object ([8cac1a0](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/8cac1a00a6f87523b88fea6962ab1194049cbacd)):

  Resolves failing OIDC conformity test "oidcc-request-uri-unsigned".

### Code Refactoring

### Features

- Add support for response_mode=form_post ([#509](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/509)) ([3e3290f](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/3e3290f811f849881f1c6bafabc1c765d9a42ac7)):

  This patch introduces support for `response_mode=form_post` as well as `response_mode` of `none` and `query` and `fragment`.

  To support this new feature your OAuth2 Client must implement the `fosite.ResponseModeClient` interface. We suggest to always return all response modes there unless you want to explicitly disable one of the response modes:

  ```go
  func (c *Client) GetResponseModes() []fosite.ResponseModeType {
  	return []fosite.ResponseModeType{
  		fosite.ResponseModeDefault,
  		fosite.ResponseModeFormPost,
  		fosite.ResponseModeQuery,
  		fosite.ResponseModeFragment,
  	}
  }
  ```

- Improve error messages ([#513](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/513)) ([fcac5a6](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/fcac5a6457c92d1eb1a389192cd0c7fb590ab8b3))
- Introduce WithExposeDebug to error interface ([625a521](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/625a5214c4a002b4d0f86e49555edf8755703968))
- Support passing repeated audience parameter in URL query ([#518](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/518)) ([47f2a31](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/47f2a31fbed137b58e4866f78ec8b9f591134f98)), closes [#504](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/504):

  Added `GetAudiences` helper function which tries to have current behavior and also support multiple/repeated audience parameters. If there are parameter is repeated, then it is not split by space. If there is only one then it is split by space. I think this is the best balance between standard/backwards behavior and allowing repeated parameter and allowing also URIs/audiences with spaces in them (which we probably all agree is probably not something anyone should be doing).

  Also added `ExactAudienceMatchingStrategy` which is slightly more suitable to use for audiences which are not URIs. In [OIDC spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) audience is described as:

  > Audience(s) that this ID Token is intended for. It MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 client_id of the Relying Party as an audience value. It MAY also contain identifiers for other audiences. In the general case, the aud value is an array of case sensitive strings. In the common special case when there is one audience, the aud value MAY be a single case sensitive string.

  `client_id` is generally not an URI, but some UUID or some other random string.

# [0.34.1](https://github.com/ory/fosite/compare/v0.34.0...v0.34.1) (2020-10-02)

fix: make redirect URL checking more strict

The OAuth 2.0 Client's Redirect URL and the Redirect URL used in the OAuth 2.0 flow do not check if the query string is equal:

1. Registering a client with allowed redirect URL `https://example.com/callback`
2. Performing OAuth2 flow and requesting redirect URL `https://example.com/callback?bar=foo`
3. Instead of an error, the browser is redirected to `https://example.com/callback?bar=foo` with a potentially successful OAuth2 response.

Additionally, matching Redirect URLs used `strings.ToLower` normalization:

1. Registering a client with allowed redirect URL `https://example.com/callback`
2. Performing OAuth2 flow and requesting redirect URL `https://example.com/CALLBACK`
3. Instead of an error, the browser is redirected to `https://example.com/CALLBACK ` with a potentially successful OAuth2 response.

This patch addresses all of these issues and adds regression tests to keep the implementation secure in future releases.

## Breaking Changes

`fosite.ErrRevocationClientMismatch` was removed because it is not part of [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.2).

Closes #429

### Bug Fixes

- **arguments:** Fixes a logic bug in MatchesExact and adds documentation ([#433](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/433)) ([10fd67b](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/10fd67bf84118affc9269ca0c0dbc8da4b0bf2cd)):

- Double-decoding of client credentials in request body ([#434](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/434)) ([48c9b41](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/48c9b41ea2dc89ec2bf58ba918c45c8430bb0ccd)):

  I noticed that client credentials are URL-decoded after being extracted from the POST body form, which was already URL-decoded by Go. The accompanying error message suggests this was copied and pasted from the HTTP basic authorization header handling, which is the only place where the extra URL-decoding was needed (as per the OAuth 2.0 spec). The result is that client credentials containing %-prefixed sequences, whether valid sequences or not, are going to fail validation.

  Remove the extra URL decoding. Add tests that ensure client credentials work with special characters in both the HTTP basic auth header and in the request body.

# [0.31.3](https://github.com/ory/fosite/compare/v0.31.2...v0.31.3) (2020-05-09)

feat(pkce): add EnforcePKCEForPublicClients config flag (#431)

Alternative proposal for the issue discussed in #389 and #391, where enforcement of PKCE is wanted only for certain clients.

Add a new flag EnforcePKCEForPublicClients which enforces PKCE only for public clients. The error hint is slightly different, as it mentions PKCE is enforced for "this client" rather than "clients". (It intentionally does not mention why it's enforced, as I think basing it on public clients is an implementation detail that servers may want to change without adding to the error hints).

Closes #389
Closes #391

fix: handle concurrent transactional errors in the refresh token grant handler (#402)

This commit provides the functionality required to address https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1719 & https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1735 by adding error checking to the RefreshTokenGrantHandler's PopulateTokenEndpointResponse method so it can deal with errors due to concurrent access. This will allow the authorization server to render a better error to the user-agent.

No longer returns fosite.ErrServerError in the event the storage. Instead a wrapped fosite.ErrNotFound is returned when fetching the refresh token fails due to it no longer being present. This scenario is caused when the user sends two or more request to refresh using the same token and one request gets into the handler just after the prior request finished and successfully committed its transaction.

Adds unit test coverage for transaction error handling logic added to the RefreshTokenGrantHandler's PopulateTokenEndpointResponse method

hash: Raise bcrypt cost factor lower bound (#321)

Users of this library can easily create the following:

hasher := fosite.BCrypt{}
hasher.Hash(..)

This is a problem because WorkFactor will default to 0 and x/crypto/bcrypt will default that to 4 (See https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt).

Instead this should be some higher cost factor. Callers who need a lower WorkFactor can still lower the cost, if needed.

oauth2: Introspection should return token type (#265)

Closes #264

This patch allows the introspection handler to return the token type (e.g. `access_token`, `refresh_token`) of the
introspected token. To achieve that, some breaking API changes have been introduced:

- `OAuth2.IntrospectToken(ctx context.Context, token string, tokenType TokenType, session Session, scope ...string) (AccessRequester, error)` is now `OAuth2.IntrospectToken(ctx context.Context, token string, tokenType TokenType, session Session, scope ...string) (TokenType, AccessRequester, error)`.
- `TokenIntrospector.IntrospectToken(ctx context.Context, token string, tokenType TokenType, accessRequest AccessRequester, scopes []string) (error)` is now `TokenIntrospector.IntrospectToken(ctx context.Context, token string, tokenType TokenType, accessRequest AccessRequester, scopes []string) (TokenType, error)`.

This patch also resolves a misconfigured json key in the `IntrospectionResponse` struct. `AccessRequester AccessRequester json:",extra"` is now properly declared as `AccessRequester AccessRequester json:"extra"`.

core: Sanitizes request body before sending it to the storage adapter (#258)

This release resolves a security issue (reported by [platform.sh](https://www.platform.sh)) related to potential storage implementations. This library used to pass
all of the request body from both authorize and token endpoints to the storage adapters. As some of these values
are needed in consecutive requests, some storage adapters chose to drop the full body to the database. This in turn caused,
with the addition of enabling POST-body based client authentication, the client secret to be leaked.

The issue has been resolved by sanitizing the request body and only including those values truly required by their
respective handlers. This lead to two breaking changes in the API:

1. The `fosite.Requester` interface has a new method `Sanitize(allowedParameters []string) Requester` which returns
   a sanitized clone of the method receiver. If you do not use your own `fosite.Requester` implementation, this won't affect you.
2. If you use the PKCE handler, you will have to add three new methods to your storage implementation. The methods
   to be added work exactly like, for example `CreateAuthorizeCodeSession`. The method signatures are as follows:

```go
type PKCERequestStorage interface {
	GetPKCERequestSession(ctx context.Context, signature string, session fosite.Session) (fosite.Requester, error)
	CreatePKCERequestSession(ctx context.Context, signature string, requester fosite.Requester) error
	DeletePKCERequestSession(ctx context.Context, signature string) error
}
```

We encourage you to upgrade to this release and check your storage implementations and potentially remove old data.

We would like to thank [platform.sh](https://www.platform.sh) for sponsoring the development of a patch that resolves this
issue.

oauth2/ropc: Set expires at for password credentials flow (#210)

Signed-off-by: Beorn Facchini <beornf@gmail.com>

### Documentation

- Fixes documentation oauth2 variable and updates old method ([#205](https://github.com/ory/fosite/issues/205)) ([fa50c80](https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/fa50c80d36bbc8dda2633b59617689d8ef21042c)):

  It seems that the documentation was declaring as OAuth2Provider the variable `oauth2Provider` whereas it used a non-declared variable `oauth2`. I renamed `oauth2` into the variable declared `oauth2Provider`.

  Furthermore, on line 333, the IntrospectToken method was called without the TokenType argument. I added the fosite.AccessToken type.
